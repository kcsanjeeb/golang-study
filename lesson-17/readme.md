# First-Class Functions

## What are First-Class Functions?

In Go, functions are **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be treated like any other value. This provides greater flexibility in code organization and enables functional programming patterns.

## First-Class Function Capabilities

- **Assignable to variables** - Store functions in variables
- **Passable as arguments** - Use functions as parameters to other functions
- **Returnable from functions** - Create functions that generate other functions

## Function Signature

A function signature defines the **parameters and return types** that characterize a function's interface.
