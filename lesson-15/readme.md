# Functions

## What are Functions?

Functions are **modular reusable blocks of code** designed to accomplish specific tasks. They take input, process it, and return output, enabling structured and organized code. A program is essentially an orchestration of function calls.

## Function Characteristics

- **Modular**: Break down complex tasks
- **Reusable**: Call multiple times with different inputs
- **Organized**: Structure code logically
- **Input/Output**: Take parameters and return values
